# Supervised-Machine-Learning---Demographics-Income
A Jupyter Notebook that utilizes supervised machine learning tactics to train an algorithm that predicts whether an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold, based on other demographic factors

There are 3 files:
  - census.csv: contains all necessary demographic data for training and testing our model
  - visuals.py: a python script that defines some functions required for the visualizations used in the notebook.
  - Finding_donors_Machine_Learning.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that explores census.csv and trains SVC, Gaussian Naive Baye, and Decision Tree models to predict individuals that make over a certain amount yearly.
